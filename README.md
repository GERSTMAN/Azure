A common perception In the Tekhelet-tying community is that the blue strings are more vulnerable to the elements, despite their pronounced elegence and cost.
See [this claim](https://twitter.com/shalom_kahana/status/1631060881772609539?t=ZT7xLtskc37uN5zoCoaXeA&s=19) made by a user in twitter, and the strong sense of agreement that the tweet raised.  
Therefore, I took to myself to verify this claim.
For that purpose I undid an old Tzitzit of mine, and measured every single strand.
I then ran a t-test to determine whether the differences should be attributed to the shade of the strings, or to positional causes.
